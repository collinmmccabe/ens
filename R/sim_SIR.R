#' sim_SIR
#'
#' sim_SIR simulates the spread of an infectious disease on a social network
#' using the Susceptible-Infected-Removed compartmental model
#'
#' @param network_el an edgelist file generated by igraph
#' @param beta a value from 0 to 1 indicating per contract probability of
#'   pathogen transmission
#' @param gamma a value from 0 to 1 indicating daily probability of
#'   recovery/removal
#' @param intxn_per_day the per capita interaction rate
#' @param days the maximum number of days for which your simulation will run
#'
#' @return vector with 5 elements, 1: number of days simulation went for, 2:
#'   final number of susceptible individuals, 3: final number of infected
#'   individuals, 4: final number of number of removed individuals, 5: maximum
#'   number of infected inviduals at any timepoint
